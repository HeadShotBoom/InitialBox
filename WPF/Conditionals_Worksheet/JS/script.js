//Celsius to Fahrenheit converter
/*
Convert a temperature to either degrees Celsius or degrees Fahrenheit depending on what the user has entered. If the user puts a “C” for the unit, the calculator should convert to Celsius. If the user puts “F” for the unit, the calculator should convert to Fahrenheit.


    Given:
Degrees (in F or C)
Unit (a string holding an “F” or a “C”)
Result:
    “The temperature is X degrees Celsius.” Or “The temperature is X degrees Fahrenheit.”
Data Sets to Test: (Note that data sets are not the only numbers that should work with your code.)
32F is 0C
100C is 212F
90F is 32.22C  */

// I will build a system of conditions and functions that is prompt driven to convert temperature.

    var currentTemp =prompt("What is the temperature in degrees Celcius? (Please type only numbers.)");
