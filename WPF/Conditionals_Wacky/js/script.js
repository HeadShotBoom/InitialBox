// Daniel Carroll, 25 July, Conditionals Assignment

// I will make a set of conditionals that hopefully will pull off something wacky.
//Informing the participant of what this site will do.
alert("You will be asked to enter 3 values over the next 3 boxes. I will then do a secret math problem on those numbers. If the answer is positive we will make a line. If it is negative we will make a box.");
//making a variable that will become loathed when it is used
var statement = "Its time to waste some time!";
//keeping with the wacky concept I made this loop.
for(var i=0;i<3;i++){
